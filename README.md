# Hi, I'm Melisa
I'm a software developer, writer, and curious human who loves building meaningful things - both with code and with words. My journey into tech started with a desire to create a life I could shape with my own hands (and keyboard ✨).

## What I'm Growing Into
Exploring projects in Java, Vue.js, and creative journaling apps
Blending design, storytelling, and functionality
Freelancing to help others bring their ideas to life

## Tech I Love Working With
Java - Spring Boot - PostreSQL
HTML - CSS - JavaScript - Vue.js
REST APIs - Git - VS Code - IntelliJ

## What Matters To Me
Simple, intentional design
Making technology feel approachable
Building things  that grow with people
