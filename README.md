### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm a new software developer and I'm currently getting ready to start a bootcamp with Tech Elevator. I'll be learning full stack and I'm very excited to be here! I'll take any advice/pointers that anyone wants to throw my way and I'd be happy to roll up my sleeves and collaborate on some projects. I definitely learn best while doing. I'm reachable at melisaedmunds@gmail.com. Fun fact: I love old school jazz, the older the better! *preferred pronouns: her/she.  :)
